════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROOT CAUSE OF ALL PREVIOUS DIVERGENCE (fixed in this version)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FIX-1 | Trail armed too early (CRITICAL — wrong exit prices)
OLD:  Trail armed when ANY profit > 0 (even 0.01 pts).
NEW:  Trail only arms when price crosses activation_price = entry ± trail_pts
where trail_pts = atr * pts_mult  (Pine exact: strategy.exit trail_points).
EFFECT: the legacy bot was replacing the initial SL (e.g. 500 pts away) with a trail
SL just 320 pts from entry the instant price moved 0.01 pts favorable.
Any normal intrabar noise could then hit this tight SL for a loss
while Pine's trail wasn't even armed yet.
LIVE-TICK MODE | Stage upgrades and breakeven are evaluated on every live tick.
The bot no longer waits for a 30-minute close to ratchet S1→S5 or activate BE.
FIX-4 | Initial SL update every bar (MEDIUM — trailing behind Pine)
KEPT: on_bar_close() updates current_sl from live ATR each bar when trail
not yet armed — matches Pine's strategy.exit(stop=) recalculation.
FIX-11 | SUPERSEDED — Trail SL always fires intrabar (TV-exact)
Pine's strategy.exit(trail_points=, trail_offset=) fires intrabar on the exact
tick that breaches trail_sl — the Exit label plots mid-candle at that price.
BAR_CLOSE_SL_EVAL does NOT suppress trail SL. It only applies to the Initial SL
(pre-arm, from the strategy body which runs at bar close via calc_on_every_tick=false).
Once trail arms, strategy.exit() takes over and always fires intrabar.
The old FIX-11 was wrong — suppressing trail SL at bar close made the bot exit
at bar_low (often 30-150 pts worse than TV's intrabar exit tick).
FIX-12 | pre_trail_sl snapshot taken before trail arms — wrong exit level (NEW)
OLD:  on_bar_close() snapshotted pre_trail_sl = state.current_sl BEFORE step 5&6
(trail arm). When trail armed this bar, step 7 still used old initial_sl.
NEW:  Snapshot moved to AFTER step 5&6 so pre_trail_sl = new trail_sl if armed.
EFFECT: Trade 2: trail armed at bar_high=66263.5 → trail_sl=66225.
Old code: pre_trail_sl=initial_sl=65855 → fired "Initial SL" at 65855.
New code: pre_trail_sl=66225 → bar_low=65855 < 66225 → "Trail SL" at 66225.
FIX-15 | Trail SL breach hold guard — 4-second wick filter (NEW)
OLD:  Once TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS consecutive Delta ticks breach the trail SL,
      exit fires instantly.
NEW:  After tick-count confirmation, a 4-second hold guard starts. The exit
      only fires if price stays below the trail SL for the full 4 seconds.
      If price recovers within the window (wick), the timer resets — no exit.
EFFECT: Trade with trail peak=61,470, trail SL=61,337: wick hit 61,315 for
      ~2 seconds then recovered to 61,374. Old code: exit at 61,337 (→ fill
      61,266 with slippage). New code: wick recovers in <4s → hold cancelled
      → bot holds and exits closer to TV's 61,374 level.
      Applies to trail-armed exits only. Initial SL, Max SL, TP unaffected.
FIX-5 | Offset recalibration mid-trade caused premature exit (NEW)
OLD:  _recalibrate_offset() fires every 30s and could jump offset by up to
50 pts in one step, instantly jerking the trail SL and causing exit.
NEW:  Once trail arms (_trail_ever_armed=True), recalibration is completely
frozen. Pre-arm recal is tightened to max 10 pts jump (was 50).
EFFECT: The +287 vs +453 trade exited early because offset jumped +36 pts
mid-trade. This makes that impossible.
FIX-6 | Binance offset drift corrupted best_price during fast moves (NEW)
OLD:  Both Binance (offset-adjusted) and Delta ticks called _evaluate_tick(),
which updates best_price. When spread widened (e.g. +40→+77 pts),
Binance ticks underestimated Delta price, so best_price didn't track
as deep as Pine's trail did.
NEW:  Post-arm, Binance ticks call _evaluate_tick_sl_only() which checks
TP/SL exits but does NOT update best_price. Only Delta ticks (push_delta_tick)
and the REST safety-net poll update best_price post-arm.
EFFECT: Trail tracks exactly as deep as Pine's trail does, closing the
~166 pt gap between bot and TradingView results.
HOW PINE'S trail_points / trail_offset WORKS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pine's strategy.exit(trail_points=P, trail_offset=O) internally does:
SHORT TRADE:
Step 1 — ACTIVATION:
activation_price = entryPrice - P   (P points below entry = profit)
Trail is NOT active until price <= activation_price
Step 2 — BEST PRICE (once armed):
  best_price = lowest price seen since trail armed (running min)

Step 3 — TRAIL SL:
  trail_sl = best_price + O
  Exit when current_price >= trail_sl
LONG TRADE:
activation_price = entryPrice + P
best_price = highest price seen since trail armed
trail_sl = best_price - O
Exit when current_price <= trail_sl
STAGE UPGRADES (live-tick mode)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pinescript Bot upgrades trailStage as soon as a live tick satisfies profitDist >= atr * triggerMult.
When stage upgrades, trail_sl recomputes immediately from existing best_price.
best_price does NOT reset on stage upgrade.
BREAKEVEN (live-tick mode)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pinescript Bot: if profitDist > atr * beMult on a live tick → SL floor = entryPrice immediately.
Once BE fires, trail continues but SL can never go worse than entry.

# FIX-14: Recovery valves for FIX-13. The plain version of FIX-13 compares

# The reference can lock up indefinitely with no way back, silently freezing
# best_price/trail during a real, fast, multi-tick rally (seen live on
# 2026-06-21, trade #350: ~70 real ticks rejected over 75s while price ran
# 64217→64267, costing ~35pts vs the TradingView trail exit on the same trade).
# Two independent recovery paths, either one re-syncs the reference:
# 1) STREAK: if N consecutive rejected ticks all move the SAME direction,
#    that's a real run, not repeated noise — accept the latest one and
#    resume normal tracking from there. A genuine single wick (jumps away
#    then snaps back) never satisfies "same direction N times in a row",
#    so the original FIX-13 protection is untouched.
# 2) STALE TIMEOUT: if no tick has been accepted for this many seconds,
#    the next tick is accepted unconditionally — covers feed gaps /
#    reconnects where price legitimately moved while we weren't listening.

# Once tick-count confirmation fires (TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS met), do NOT
# exit immediately. Instead require the price to stay BELOW the trail SL for
# this many wall-clock seconds before the exit fires.
#
# Problem it solves: the streak-override (FIX-14b) correctly identified a real
# 3-tick directional move and accepted 61,315 as a "real" tick — but that tick
# was still a wick (price recovered to 61,374 within ~2 seconds). Because the
# tick-count confirmation fired the exit instantly, the bot closed at 61,266
# (71pt slippage from 61,337 trail SL) while TV held and exited at 61,374.
#
# How it works:
#   1. Tick count reaches TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS → hold timer starts (no exit).
#   2. Each subsequent confirming tick: checks how long price has stayed below SL.
#   3. If price recovers above SL within the window → timer resets, no exit.
#   4. If price stays below SL for >= TRAIL_SL_BREACH_HOLD_SECS → exit fires.
#
# Why 4 seconds: real wick spikes on BTC recover within 1-2 seconds. A genuine
# break stays below for 5+ seconds. 4s is the safe midpoint — catches real
# breaks while ignoring most wicks.
#
# Note: ONLY applies to trail-armed exits. Initial SL fires immediately as before
# (it uses BAR_CLOSE_SL_EVAL anyway). Max SL and TP are also unaffected.

        trail_armed=True uses TRAIL_SL_CONFIRM_TICKS (lower) instead of
        SL_CONFIRM_TICKS so trail exits fire quickly like Pine's intrabar
        simulation, while the initial SL keeps full spike protection.

        MODE A — Tick-count mode (SL_CONFIRM_TICKS > 0, RECOMMENDED):
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Requires SL_CONFIRM_TICKS consecutive Delta-source ticks above the

        counter to 0. Binance ticks (source="other") are completely ignored
        for breach counting — they can never trigger or sustain a breach.

        This is Option 1 (feed isolation) + Option 3 (tick-count) combined:
          • Option 1: only source="delta" ticks advance the counter.
          • Option 3: need REQUIRED_TICKS clean Delta ticks above SL.

        Result: the 47-second fight between Binance (61,249) and Delta (61,179)

        reset the counter, Binance ticks above SL are ignored.
